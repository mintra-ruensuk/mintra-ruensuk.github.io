	I am a data and analytics professional at <a href="https://www.scb.co.th/">Siam Commercial Bank (SCB)</a>, where I am responsible for ensuring the proper design, performance, and security of the analytics platform. I received my PhD in Creative Design Engineering from <a href="http://www.unist.ac.kr">the Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology (UNIST)</a>, where I was advised by <a href="http://www.whereveriam.org/work/">Ian Oakley</a> at <a href="http://interactions.unist.ac.kr">the Interactions Lab</a> and <a href="http://hwajunghong.com/">Hwajung Hong</a> at <a href="https://dxd-lab.github.io/">the DxD Lab</a>. My research interests include affective computing and human-computer interaction. In my work, I have focused on using machine learning for advanced data analysis and predictive modeling, and I have a strong background in software engineering and agile development methodologies. I have also taught at the undergraduate and graduate levels, providing mentorship and guidance to students in their academic and professional development.
