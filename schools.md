I enjoy being in a school setting. I find that it helps me to feel rejuvenated and energized. Just thinking about my memories from school brings me happiness. I hope you will enjoy hearing about them.

	UNIST is located in Ulsan, South Korea. I moved to UNIST in Fall 2017, which was my first time living outside of my home country. My first impression of UNIST was very positive. The campus is beautiful and is surrounded by mountains with fresh air. I found it to be a perfect place for focusing on my studies, although at times I did feel that the school was somewhat isolated from other amenities.

<p>
	Stamford is an internationally renowned school located in Bangkok, Thailand. The student body and staff at Stamford come from over 100 different countries. I had the opportunity to serve as an IT Lecturer at this cool school, where I met a diverse group of talented students from around the world. I really enjoyed teaching them technical skills and was happy to see many of them go on to graduate and pursue successful careers in fields such as programming and design. These students will always hold a special place in my heart.

	AIT is one of the top international graduate schools in Thailand. It is a place that feels like home to me. Although I spent only a short time at AIT, less than 2 years, it was filled with many happy memories. AIT has a strong reputation in Asia and attracts talented students from around the world to its programs. In Thailand, AIT is a place where many people come to chase their dreams, and I was fortunate to be one of them. As a student at AIT, I was privileged to be taught by exceptional professors and to make friends with people from other countries. Life at AIT was wonderful. The campus is surrounded by trees, houses, restaurants, and bicycle paths, and bicyclists are actually more powerful than car drivers on campus. Just be careful when you're off campus! I miss AIT so much.

	<h2>Mahanakorn University of Technology</h2>
	<p>the first place that completely changed my world</p>
</header>
<span class="image fit"><img src="{{ "/images/mut.jpg" | absolute_url }}" alt="" /></span>
<p>
	MUT may not be the most well-known school in Thailand, but it has played a crucial role in my journey to where I am today. I spent five years at MUT as a student and later as a junior lecturer, and I enjoyed every minute of it. Before joining MUT, I was a nobody, but the professors there helped to shape me and fuel my passion for programming. I will always be grateful for the time I spent at MUT and the knowledge and skills I gained there.
